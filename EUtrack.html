										<span style="font-weight: bold">Abstract: </span>
										In the past years, Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) have evolved into Cooperative ITS (C-ITS). Based on the detected traffic, controllers generated “green waves”. By means of V2V and V2I communication this was optimized to GLOSA (Green Light Optimal Speed Advisory) and advanced warning systems. Those concepts have been tested in large scale deployment projects like C-MobILE and are now state of the art. In NextPerception, Driver Monitoring Systems were extended to take into account the emotional state of the driver.
										<br>
										<br>
										In recent years Digital Twins have been the next step in making automation tasks more performant in domains where sensors, edge devices, cloud computing and AI are combined. We see that the usage of Digital Twins in Mobility is lagging behind and, when used, the Twin is only modelling one aspect on a single device.
										<br>
										<br>
										Simulation and data analysis are well handled in the Mobility and Traffic domain. Real-time reaction to changing situations is commonly used to guarantee safety and improved traffic flow. The basic building blocks for a digital twin are there but are insufficient to handle the situation where the actors are moving and changing from one situation to another and owned by different stakeholders.
										<br>
										<br>
										To model those complex situations, we need cooperating digital twins that dynamically work together in a trustworthy system of systems where a system can join our leave a group of heterogeneous twins.
										<br>
										<br>
										The DistriMuse project, which started in May 2024, intends to work on solutions to combine observations from various traffic participants into a common view of the situation. The focus in the project is particularly on the observation and protection of vulnerable road users in traffic situations. Furthermore, a match will be made between the focus of attention of the driver, and the developments in traffic, specifically focusing on the attention paid to VRU’s.

										<a target= "view_window">Geert Vanstraelen</a> is head of the R&D at Macq, Belgium.
										Geert joined the R&D department at Macq in 1992, working in research projects to define programming languages for PLC's and the open source SCADA project Open OBviews. He participated in national and European research projects such as Distributed SL, Superviseurs corrects, efficaces et robustes, Capteur Routier Multimodal, MULTICAM, Open SCADA, VARIES (Variability Management), REVaMP2 (Product Line Engineering). When the company focus shifted from automation to traffic, research moved to smart mobility projects like C-MobILE (C-ITS), PoliVisu (Policy Development based on Advanced Geospatial Data Analytics and Visualisation), TASPAIR (Traffic Analysis while Sustaining Privacy with Artificial Intelligence for Recognition), NextPerception (Sensor fusion), TIoCPS (Trustworthy and Smart Communities of Cyber-Physical Systems), MIRAI (Machine Intelligence techniques for smart and sustainable planning and operation of IoT and Edge computing applications) TAPCOP (Traffic AI Prediction of Common Operational Picture), BRIGHTER (Fast pixel micro-bolometer imaging), SINTRA (Security of Critical Infrastructure by Multi-Modal Dynamic Sensing and AI) and DistriMuSe (Distributed Multi-Sensor systems).
