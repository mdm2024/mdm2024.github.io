<h2>IEEE MDM 2024: Call for Workshop Proposals</h2>

<p>Several workshops will be held together with the IEEE MDM 2024 conference. Workshops are
planned to take place on July 3, 2023, the day before the main conference, each of them
running anywhere between half a day and a full day.</p>

<p>
    The logistics of the workshops will be handled by the MDM 2024 organization. Specifically,
MDM 2024 will take care of facilities, catering, and the registration process pertinent to all hosted
workshops.
</p>

<p>
    The organizers of accepted workshops are required to announce the workshop and call for
papers, solicit submissions, invite and coordinate with PC members to ensure that controversial
submissions are resolved, and decide upon the final workshop program that must be published
at least two weeks before the early registration deadline. The submission deadline of the
workshops must be set 1-2 weeks after the notification date of the main conference. In addition,
each workshop must collaborate with the Proceedings Chair for the purpose of ensuring timely
completion of the camera-ready copies before April 28, 2023 (TBC), when official conference
proceedings are due. A workshop paper is allowed up to 6 proceedings pages.
</p>

<p>
    Publication of call-for-papers and participation as well as eventual workshop reports in various
outlets are encouraged.
</p>

<p>
    Proposal evaluation criteria include the following: relevance to MDM, scientific quality,
perceived interest and past performance (e.g., previous submission counts and/or workshop
participants), and overlap with other proposals.
</p>

<p>The deadline for the receipt of proposals to be co-located with MDM 2024 is: December 9, 2022.</p>

<p>Notification of acceptance will occur by: December 23, 2022.</p>
