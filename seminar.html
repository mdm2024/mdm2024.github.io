<h2>IEEE MDM 2024: Call for Advanced Seminars</h2>

<p>The 24<sup>th</sup> IEEE International Conference on Mobile Data Management (MDM2024) invites submissions for Advanced Seminar (Tutorial) proposals on all topics related to mobile data management (for a full list of topics, please see the research track CFP of the conference).</p>

<p>Advanced Seminar proposals should be no more than four pages in length and must follow the IEEE conference style templates. Advanced Seminars are planned to take place as separate sessions in parallel with the other tracks of the conference.</p>
<p>Proposals are accepted for regular seminars (3 hours length) and short seminars (1.5 hours length). The intended length of the seminar should be explicitly indicated in the proposal, though depending on the results of the assessment of the proposal, the length is subject to modifications. Proposals should identify any other venues in which all or part of the seminar has been or will be presented, and explain how the seminar proposal for MDM 2024 differs from other offerings.</p>

<p>The logistics of the Advanced Seminars will be handled by the MDM 2024 organization. Specifically, MDM 2024 local organizers will take care of facilities, catering, and the registration process pertinent to all hosted Advanced Seminars.</p>

<p>At least one organizer of an accepted Advanced Seminar is required to attend the conference to carry out the presentation. Each accepted Advanced Seminar will receive one complimentary conference registration. Proposal evaluation criteria include the following: relevance to MDM, scientific quality, perceived interest and overlap with MDM tutorials in the past.</p>


<!--
<p>Proposal  evaluation  criteria include  the  following:  relevance to  MDM,
